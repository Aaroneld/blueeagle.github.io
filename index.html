              <p class="blog-post-text">
                These past weeks have been quite enjoyable. I'll say, I haven't done much on this site in the last week or two. Really my Github reflects as lack of activity.
                I'm not getting lazy however. It's really just an intense focus on homework and side projects. See, recently I became a part of my school's cyber security club.
                Taking part in the challenge of attacking and securing systems in a lab environment has been exciting. As a result I began a new port scanning active firewall 
                system called PortCheck. It still is very early in development so I can take it in any direction at the moment and more details will be released as it matures.

                Further, my other project has been to learn NodeJS so I can make a more dynamic full stack site to replace this. It will take a moment, especially with my sights 
                elsewhere so please be patient. I also realize that I start projects faster than I can update this site to reflect them. In the new version of the site I hope to 
                implement and auto-updating page to reflect all the new repositories.

                It has been a while since I've even looked over this site. To be honest, I was sort of cringing at the lack of dynamics offered by the static site hosting it is platformed on.
                See, I hosted this on Github Pages the day I discovered Pages exist. If I had known from the beginning that it only allowed me to use one page for the whole site and it lacks a number of basic features I would have decided to go with a more established host.
                I am currently working on building a replacement for this site that I will have hosted elsewhere and I'm thinking to use Flask to build templates for it. This site was built almost from scratch excepting some imports from bootstrap for style. I'm not stylish, at least Bootstrap is!

                In the long adventure of learning, testing, breaking, fixing, learning, testing, and implementing, 
                I eventually decided most features I'm looking to implement will be outside of this site. It will 
                still be a playground for my learning the limits of a static site. It's future replacement will 
                feature a robust backend with plenty of web apps to serve you and I both! I'm optimistic that between 
                college and learning on the side I will be able to keep moving forward and see through the completion 
                of this site as well as the some <a href="https://github.com/BlueEagle/scripts">side projects</a> I have in the works.

                I've always been fairly confident about what I do. For me confidence comes from the will power to push forward and 
                the knowledge that in the end, everything will work out. This last week I was able to be confident about my schoolwork 
                as I was able to complete most of it in a reasonable amount of time. Until crunching a little bit today I felt pretty under weather.
                Student life is far different than I expected. The real challenge seems to be completing all assignments days ahead of time
                there is enough buffer time to not have to worry. I will use a power stance to empower myself with confidence over this week.
                We will see what comes of it! Over this past week I've seen confidence as a great comfort. Though some time at the end of this 
                week my assignments seemed impossible to complete, after pursuing them for half the day I realized I was overdoing one of them.

                Engaging myself has been something I've learned over time. As someone who has a natural desire to learn in an ever more crowded
                world, I have had to learn to find sanctuary. I've noticed certain things that help me pull away from distractions in the world
                and focus intently on finishing each task I have in front of me. First and foremost is the things that run through my head constantly
                When I set out to accomplish something I find myself writing a list of all things that consume my brain power and prevent me from 
                giving my all. Just as in the scripture <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67-68?lang=eng#67">D&C 88:67-68</a>,
                we can chose to allow ourselves to be consumed in ignorance, or devote our whole selves to aquiring and utilizing knowledge for betterment.
