      "I recently made a life changing decision. After trudging through many general education style classes at my previous school I was becoming extremely unenthusiastic about my course of education. I was depressed that despite having known all my life where I want to take my career, there did not seem to be a path to go down. Constantly I heard others around me who couldn't even decide what they wanted. It seemed like all the educators were directing their full attention to those who needed to make that decision. A decision I made long ago.",
      "My previous plan seemed like the most logical plan at first. I would go to a college and begin my education at a very low cost just to get my general education finished and create time in my schedule to put all my effort into studying my major. It would have taken me a minimum of 4 years, I wouldn't have been surprised if it ended up being 5 years.",
      "Then a friend told me about [Lambda School.](https://lambdaschool.com) It was one of those fancy new schools I had looked into years prior. In years past I had written off coding bootcamps because they were often not accredited, very expensive, provided less job opportunities than traditional college, and were known for teaching less computer science theory than I desired.",
      "With my suspicions in mind I looked over the school with extreme skepticism. To my surprise, it seemed to directly counter most of my reservations. I will spare you the full details of the school and instead direct you to do your own research! In short, I have made the decision to enroll and begin my education at Lambda School with great comfort and excitement!",
      "With less than a year of course content I'm determined that I will be more than capable to perform full stack web development and stand up to competitors in a constantly moving job market. I have a vision for myself that within a year from now I should be employed or seeking employment as a full time web programmer exposing fun and exciting web services and creating tools that anyone can use in their browser or on their phone. I came to this realization in part because my past projects were only useful for me. If I dropped a link to my friends, none of them could even use my software without advanced technical knowledge or the ability to install software locally on their computers. This surely is not marketable!",
      "I will make money doing what I love! I can continue having fun in my editor and provide for a family in the process. I love [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com) for providing a path for me!"
