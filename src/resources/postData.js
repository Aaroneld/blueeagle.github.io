      "I recently made a life changing decision. After trudging through many general education style classes at my previous school I was becoming extremely unenthusiastic about my course of education. I was depressed that despite having known all my life where I want to take my career, there did not seem to be a path to go down. Constantly I heard others around me who couldn't even decide what they wanted. It seemed like all the educators were directing their full attention to those who needed to make that decision. A decision I made long ago.",
      "My previous plan seemed like the most logical plan at first. I would go to a college and begin my education at a very low cost just to get my general education finished and create time in my schedule to put all my effort into studying my major. It would have taken me a minimum of 4 years, I wouldn't have been surprised if it ended up being 5 years.",
      "Then a friend told me about [Lambda School.](https://lambdaschool.com) It was one of those fancy new schools I had looked into years prior. In years past I had written off coding bootcamps because they were often not accredited, very expensive, provided less job opportunities than traditional college, and were known for teaching less computer science theory than I desired.",
      "With my suspicions in mind I looked over the school with extreme skepticism. To my surprise, it seemed to directly counter most of my reservations. I will spare you the full details of the school and instead direct you to do your own research! In short, I have made the decision to enroll and begin my education at Lambda School with great comfort and excitement!",
      "With less than a year of course content I'm determined that I will be more than capable to perform full stack web development and stand up to competitors in a constantly moving job market. I have a vision for myself that within a year from now I should be employed or seeking employment as a full time web programmer exposing fun and exciting web services and creating tools that anyone can use in their browser or on their phone. I came to this realization in part because my past projects were only useful for me. If I dropped a link to my friends, none of them could even use my software without advanced technical knowledge or the ability to install software locally on their computers. This surely is not marketable!",
      "I will make money doing what I love! I can continue having fun in my editor and provide for a family in the process. I love [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com) for providing a path for me!"

      "It has been a while since I've even looked over this site. To be honest, I was sort of cringing at the lack of dynamics offered by the static site hosting it is platformed on. See, I hosted this on Github Pages the day I discovered Pages exist. If I had known from the beginning that it only allowed me to use one page for the whole site and it lacks a number of basic features I would have decided to go with a more established host.",
      "I am currently working on building a replacement for this site that I will have hosted elsewhere and I'm thinking to use Flask to build templates for it. This site was built almost from scratch excepting some imports from bootstrap for style. I'm not stylish, at least Bootstrap is!"

      "These past weeks have been quite enjoyable. I'll say, I haven't done much on this site in the last week or two. Really my Github reflects as lack of activity. I'm not getting lazy however. It's really just an intense focus on homework and side projects. See, recently I became a part of my school's cyber security club. Taking part in the challenge of attacking and securing systems in a lab environment has been exciting. As a result I began a new port scanning active firewall system called PortCheck. It still is very early in development so I can take it in any direction at the moment and more details will be released as it matures.",
      "Further, my other project has been to learn NodeJS so I can make a more dynamic full stack site to replace this. It will take a moment, especially with my sights elsewhere so please be patient. I also realize that I start projects faster than I can update this site to reflect them. In the new version of the site I hope to implement and auto-updating page to reflect all the new repositories."
